ALL STEPS: Summary and Step by Step Guide

Perfect! Let me provide you with a comprehensive summary of what we've accomplished:

âœ… Successfully Implemented Complete Restaurant Order Flow

Topics Created:
â€¢  restaurant-orders-raw - Raw restaurant/general orders input
â€¢  restaurant-Orders-processed - Processed restaurant orders output
â€¢  general-Orders-processed - Processed general orders output
â€¢  orders-raw - Original order flow (still working)
â€¢  orders-processed - Original processed orders (still working)

âœ… End-to-End Flows Working:

#### 1. Original Order Flow (Still Working)
â€¢  Create Order: POST /api/orders/create
â€¢  Flow: Order Creation â†’ orders-raw â†’ Streams Processing â†’ orders-processed â†’ Consumer
â€¢  âœ… Test Result: Order processed successfully with calculated totals and high-value detection

#### 2. Restaurant Order Flow (New)
â€¢  Create Restaurant Order: POST /api/restaurant-orders/create with "orderType": "RESTAURANT"
â€¢  Flow: Order Creation â†’ restaurant-orders-raw â†’ Streams Routing â†’ restaurant-Orders-processed â†’ Consumer
â€¢  âœ… Test Result: Restaurant order routed correctly to restaurant-specific topic

#### 3. General Order Flow (New)
â€¢  Create General Order: POST /api/restaurant-orders/create with "orderType": "GENERAL"
â€¢  Flow: Order Creation â†’ restaurant-orders-raw â†’ Streams Routing â†’ general-Orders-processed â†’ Consumer
â€¢  âœ… Test Result: General order routed correctly to general-specific topic

ðŸš€ How to Test Each Flow:

# 1. Test Original Order Flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customerId": "customer-123", "amount": 150.00, "productIds": ["P1", "P2"]}'

# 2. Test Restaurant Order Flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/restaurant-orders/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": "restaurant-001",
    "finalAmount": 85.50,
    "orderType": "RESTAURANT",
    "orderLineItems": [
      {"item": "Pizza", "count": 2, "amount": 32.00},
      {"item": "Salad", "count": 1, "amount": 15.50}
    ]
  }'

# 3. Test General Order Flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/restaurant-orders/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": "warehouse-001",
    "finalAmount": 250.00,
    "orderType": "GENERAL",
    "orderLineItems": [
      {"item": "Laptop", "count": 1, "amount": 899.99}
    ]
  }'

  âœ… Services and Ports:
  â€¢  Order Creation Service: http://localhost:8080 (handles both order types)
  â€¢  Order Processing Streams Service: http://localhost:8081 (processes all flows)
  â€¢  Order Consumer Service: http://localhost:8082 (consumes all processed orders)
  â€¢  Kafka UI: http://localhost:8085 (monitor topics and messages)
  â€¢  Kafka Broker: localhost:9092 (external), broker:29092 (internal)

  âœ… Kafka Topics Overview:
  orders-raw                    â†’ orders-processed                (Original flow)
  restaurant-orders-raw         â†’ restaurant-Orders-processed    (Restaurant orders)
  restaurant-orders-raw         â†’ general-Orders-processed       (General orders)

  ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Achieved:

  1. âœ… Dual Order Processing: Both simple orders (with calculation) and complex restaurant orders (with routing)
  2. âœ… Smart Routing: Restaurant orders split by type (RESTAURANT vs GENERAL) to different topics
  3. âœ… Multiple Consumers: Dedicated consumers for each order type
  4. âœ… Auto Topic Creation: Topics created automatically when first message is sent
  5. âœ… Kafka 4.0 KRaft: Latest Kafka with KRaft mode (no Zookeeper)
  6. âœ… Docker Containerized: All services running in Docker with proper networking
  7. âœ… End-to-End Testing: All flows tested and working

  ðŸ“Š Real-time Monitoring:
  â€¢  Use Kafka UI at http://localhost:8085 to see messages flowing through topics
  â€¢  Check container logs: docker logs order-processing-streams-service
  â€¢  Monitor consumer groups: docker logs order-consumer-service

  The complete restaurant order flow is now working alongside the original order processing flow! Both systems can handle their respective order types and route them to appropriate consumers for further processing.
